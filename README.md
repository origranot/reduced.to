### About:

I created this repo a long time ago (more than 3 years), made this public for Hacktoberfest! This is a very good
opportunity for beginners to start their journey with open source. All PR's are welcome!

## Ideas for contributing (Updating)

- UI improvments:
  - Animations
  - Dark/Light mode toggle
  - Fonts?
- Add some tests?
- Typescript?
- Migrate into backend framework (eg. nestjs)
- Better readme?
- Add more ideas..
- Just create a PR already :)
